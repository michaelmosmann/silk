# Javadoc

<abstract>
The philosophy of the provided javadoc is to just add documentation where it is needed or additional information (e.g. about the purpose, high level concepts or thoughts) are available. 
Silk communicates through types making concepts explicit. Therefore it is often not needed to describe what methods do.
